    <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
    <p id="paragraph">The Faculty of Teacher Training and Education, Sebelas Maret University, Surakarta is an 
    Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK) which has 24 study programs in 6
    majors. Each study program has it own characteristics in producing superior, strong and
    intelligent educational staff. <br><br>
    
    The Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK) study program is planned to 
    take shelter in the management of the Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)
    department. This placement revises our previous statement, where PTIK study program is 
    under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduate who are
    prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs. So, it would be better if PTIK was
    under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as Building Engineering 
    Education, and Mechanical Engineering Education. To meet the needs of lecturers in the 
    field of informatin technology that cannot be met by PTK department, PTIK will conduct
    resource sharing with the mathematics study program.
