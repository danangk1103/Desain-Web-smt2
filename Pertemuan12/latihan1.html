    <h1>PTIK FKIP UNS</h1>
    <p>The <ubah>Faculty of Teacher Training and Education</ubah>, <ubah>Sebelas Maret University</ubah>, Surakarta is an 
    <ubah>Educational Personnel Education Institution (LPTK)</ubah> which has 24 study programs in 6
    majors. Each study program has it own characteristics in producing superior, strong and
    intelligent educational staff. <br><br>
    
    <ubah>The Informatics and Computer Technology Education (PTIK)</ubah> study program is planned to 
    take shelter in the management of the <ubah>Engineering and Vocational Education (PTK)</ubah>
    department. This placement revises our previous statement, where PTIK study program is 
    under the P.MIPA department. PTIK is a study program that will produce graduate who are
    <ubah>prioritized to teach in vocational/vocational programs</ubah>. So, it would be better if PTIK was
    under the PTK department which oversees vocational programs such as <ubah>Building Engineering 
    Education</ubah>, and <ubah>Mechanical Engineering Education</ubah>. To meet the needs of lecturers in the 
    field of informatin technology that cannot be met by PTK department, PTIK will conduct
    <ubah>resource sharing with the mathematics study program</ubah>.
